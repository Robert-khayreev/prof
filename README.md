2. **Instantly see a profile** - no browsing, just start swiping!
3. View one profile at a time with full details

## Technical Architecture

### Models

- **User**: Manages user sessions and profile ownership
- **Profile**: Stores profile information and relationships
- **ProfileInteraction**: Records all user interactions with profiles

### Controllers

- **HomeController**: Landing page with conditional navigation
- **SessionsController**: User login and logout
- **RegistrationsController**: User sign up
- **ProfilesController**: CRUD operations and analytics for profiles (requires authentication)
- **SpectatorController**: Anonymous profile viewing and interaction tracking (public)
- **ApplicationController**: Base controller with authentication helpers

### Key Technologies

- **Ruby on Rails 8.0**: Backend framework
- **BCrypt**: Secure password encryption
- **has_secure_password**: Rails authentication system
- **ActiveStorage**: Image upload and management
- **SQLite3**: Database
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Frontend interactivity and tracking
- **CSS3**: Modern, responsive UI with Tinder-style animations

### Database Schema

```ruby
# users
- email (string, unique)
- password_digest (string, encrypted)
- session_token (string, unique)
- timestamps

# profiles
- name (string)
- age (integer)
- gender_identity (string, optional: male, female, non-binary, genderqueer, agender, other)
- height (integer, cm, optional)
- income_level (string, optional: 0-30k, 30k-50k, 50k-75k, 75k-100k, 100k-150k, 150k-200k, 200k+)
- description (text)
- user_id (integer, indexed)
- active (boolean)
- timestamps

# profile_interactions
- profile_id (integer, indexed)
- viewer_session (string)
- action (string: 'right_swipe', 'left_swipe')
- time_spent (integer, seconds, required)
- scroll_depth (integer, 0-100 percentage, required)
- image_index (integer, 0-based index of photo being viewed when swiped)
- timestamps
```

### How Analytics Work

The application uses a **single-record-per-view** system for accurate analytics:

1. **When a user views a profile**: Page loads, timer starts, scroll tracking begins, image navigation tracking starts
2. **When user swipes (left or right)**: 
   - Creates ONE ProfileInteraction record with:
     - Action type (right_swipe or left_swipe)
     - Time spent viewing (in seconds)
     - Scroll depth (0-100%, how much they scrolled)
     - Image index (which photo they were viewing when they swiped)
3. **Metrics calculation**:
   - **Views** = Total swipe actions (right + left)
   - **Success Rate** = (Right Swipes / Total Views) √ó 100
   - **Averages** = Mean of time_spent, scroll_depth, and photos viewed across all interactions
   - **Photo Performance** = Distribution analysis of swipe actions by image position

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ No duplicate records
- ‚úÖ Every interaction has complete data
- ‚úÖ Accurate, reliable analytics
- ‚úÖ Views always equal right_swipes + left_swipes
